But what does it really mean, and why is it so important for your comfort during outdoor activities? Simply put, moisture-wicking fabrics are designed to work with you. When you’re pushing yourself outdoors, the last thing you want is to feel weighed down by sweat. These fabrics pull sweat away from your skin through capillary action, where moisture moves through tiny gaps in the fabric and fibers, transferring it to the surface so you stay dry, no matter how intense your activity. Because they dry quickly, you won’t be left with that uncomfortable, sticky feeling. The result? You remain comfortable and dry, allowing your body to naturally regulate its temperature, which in turn helps you focus fully on your adventure.<\/p>","text_size":20}}},"block_order":["richtext_pKwzJR"],"custom_css":[".width--narrow {max-width: 80%;}"],"settings":{"section_width":"narrow","text_alignment_desktop":"center","text_alignment_mobile":"center","section_padding_top":60,"section_padding_bottom":60,"colors":"white"}},"rich_text_c3WMxi":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"heading_YUYkgn":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Pumpkin Towne","heading--text-size":42}},"richtext_Wnmnwx":{"type":"richtext","disabled":true,"settings":{"text":"<p>Use this text block to show store announcements, advertise products and collections, or simply welcome visitors to your store.<\/p>","text_size":14}}},"block_order":["heading_YUYkgn","richtext_Wnmnwx"],"disabled":true,"custom_css":["h2 {line-height: 1;}"],"settings":{"section_width":"narrow","text_alignment_desktop":"center","text_alignment_mobile":"center","section_padding_top":60,"section_padding_bottom":60,"colors":"light"}},"gallery_cenjM6":{"type":"gallery","blocks":{"image_cKJfHm":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IMG_0037_2.jpg","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/infinity-jacket","title":"","subheading":"","overlay-btn-text":"","show-gradient-overlay":false,"overlay_font_color":"#262428","button_text_color":"#ffffff","button_background_color":"#242424","overlay_color":"#ffffff"}},"image_Q9ejbH":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/015A5025_1.jpg","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/olga-legging","title":"","subheading":"","overlay-btn-text":"","show-gradient-overlay":false,"overlay_font_color":"#262428","button_text_color":"#ffffff","button_background_color":"#242424","overlay_color":"#ffffff"}},"image_kPyfem":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/greybag_08ca31fa-cced-45ef-b573-ce82f87cde1c.png","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/classic-tote-bag","title":"","subheading":"","overlay-btn-text":"","show-gradient-overlay":false,"overlay_font_color":"#262428","button_text_color":"#ffffff","button_background_color":"#242424","overlay_color":"#ffffff"}},"image_KCbVKq":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/model41_f498d806-02ac-4d55-b9af-039fe34be297_2.jpg","link":"shopify:\/\/products\/pique-quarter-zip","title":"","subheading":"","overlay-btn-text":"","show-gradient-overlay":false,"overlay_font_color":"#262428","button_text_color":"#ffffff","button_background_color":"#242424","overlay_color":"#ffffff"}}},"block_order":["image_cKJfHm","image_Q9ejbH","image_kPyfem","image_KCbVKq"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"","description":"","content-position":"hide","buttons_style":"filled","section_padding_top":0,"section_padding_bottom":0,"section-width":"content","remove-spacing":true,"full-width":false,"colors":"light"}},"rich_text_hMcKzL":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"heading_VVhkgh":{"type":"heading","disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":"Pumpkin Towne","heading--text-size":42}},"richtext_MpEeRp":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"text":"<p>Pumpkin Towne at Wellington Green may not be your typical pumpkin patch, but it's the ideal spot to dive into these festivities with stylish fall apparel.

Fibers can either be hydrophobic, which repels water, or hydrophilic, which absorbs water. How these fabrics are used also determines how well they manage moisture. \nSynthetic Fibers make up the majority of moisture-wicking fabrics. Hydrophobic fibers like polyester and nylon excel at moving sweat away from your skin. Unlike natural fibers, which tend to hold onto moisture, synthetics resist soaking it up and allow sweat to pass through and evaporate.\n\n• Polyester is lightweight, durable, and does not absorb much water, allowing sweat to evaporate faster and keeping you dry.\n• Nylon absorbs moisture slightly more than polyester but still manages it well. Additionally, it is smooth and strong, making it ideal for activewear.\n• Polypropylene is extremely hydrophobic, making it excellent at repelling moisture and ensuring the fabric stays dry even in heavy sweating situations.\n• Spandex\/Elastane is often blended with other fibers. While it is not inherently moisture-wicking, spandex provides stretch and flexibility to activewear, enhancing comfort and mobility.","section_heading_2":"What about the Way Fabrics are Constructed?","image_2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/015A4271_1_113313122_9887dcaf-f2e9-4636-9efb-2e755e80687b.jpg","content_2":"Fabric Construction significantly boosts moisture movement. The manner in which a fabric is constructed influences moisture management, affecting how sweat moves from your skin to the fabric’s outer layer and how quickly it evaporates. Many moisture-wicking materials are knit rather than woven. The knitting process creates small gaps between the yarn loops, facilitating airflow and increasing breathability. Warp-knit fabrics are especially effective at wicking moisture due to their open structure, allowing sweat to evaporate more quickly. Some fabrics are designed with two layers: an Inner Layer, typically made from hydrophilic fibers like cotton blends or Merino wool, which absorb moisture from your skin, and an Outer Layer, made from hydrophobic fibers like polyester, that repel water, helping moisture spread out and evaporate rapidly. The texture of the fabric also impacts its wicking ability. For instance, microfiber fabrics contain finer fibers than human hair, increasing the surface area for moisture to evaporate","section_heading_3":"What Finishes and Treatments Enhance the Moisture-Wicking Properties of Our Clothes?","image_3":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/015A4271_1_1_47ba4f00-57eb-4955-9eb0-e6fb0165a952.jpg","content_3":"To enhance moisture management, our moisture-wicking fabrics undergo special finishes and treatments. Applying a hydrophilic finish can significantly boost moisture-wicking ability, even in synthetic fibers like polyester, which are naturally hydrophobic. These enhancements help the fabric draw sweat away from your skin more effectively. Special coatings can also improve the fabric’s ability to spread moisture across a larger surface area, allowing for quicker evaporation.\n\nWhile not directly linked to wicking, we also apply Antimicrobial Treatments to our moisture-wicking fabrics to help prevent odors caused by sweat and bacteria.\n\nHow Do Our Moisture-Wicking Fabrics Perform? We measure the performance of our moisture-wicking fabrics based on several important factors:\n• Wicking Rate: This shows how quickly moisture is pulled away from your skin to the fabric’s outer surface.\n• Drying Time: After absorbing moisture, the fabric needs to dry quickly to keep you comfortable during your activities.\n• Breathability: The fabric should allow air to flow through, helping sweat evaporate and preventing moisture build-up on your skin."}},"rich_text_jpecLY":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"heading_UnXkaw":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Your Moisture-Wicking Essentials","heading--text-size":30}},"richtext_wwhAm8":{"type":"richtext","settings":{"text":"<p>Our quick-dry women’s activewear is crafted with moisture-wicking technology, but here are a few bestsellers to help you start your journey. <\/p><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/galtsand.com\/products\/lotus-jacket?\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Lotus Jacket<\/strong><\/span><\/a> is your go-to layering piece.
